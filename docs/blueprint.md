- Accent color: Black (#000000) used sparingly for text, icons, and key interactive elements to create emphasis.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, to ensure readability and modernity; 'Playfair' (serif) for headers, giving an elegant feel.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Mobile-first, responsive design with a focus on grid layouts for products and collapsible sidebars for filters on smaller screens.
- Subtle hover effects (shadow/zoom) on product cards to provide visual feedback and enhance user interaction.
